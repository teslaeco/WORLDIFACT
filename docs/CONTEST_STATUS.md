# WORLDIFACT — TerraformingPlanet Astra heroine released

Updated 1 October 2026.

## VERIFIED — one bounded live Astra character generation

The owner explicitly approved one paid GPT-6 Astra / Oracle / Blender character test with an unchanged maximum provider reservation of USD 1.75 and no automatic retry.

Workflow [36815867329](https://github.com/teslaeco/WORLDIFACT/actions/runs/36815867329), exact source `a5c8266f7c4b5c3348d6913bd48e90d759917f0d`, completed successfully.

The three chat reference images were deliberately not published to the public GitHub repository and therefore were not passed as image bytes through this Actions test. Their visible character design was translated into the fixed generation brief: adult silver-haired sci-fi heroine, pearl-white/black/cyan outfit, empty hands and no glowing orb. This verifies the written-design generation path, not pixel-level multi-view similarity to those private chat images.

## VERIFIED — production integration

PR #157 passed all five exact-head checks at `31e0a023b61570cefc898f2a00a6e4e328691ae4` and merged as `2f8a94cca1f7d32a0a1706bd031024c926db0a3c`.

The integration:

- exposes only the exact generated job through `/api/avatar/terraforming-heroine`
- keeps bounded GLB validation and cache controls
- never starts generation while loading an avatar
- adds `TerraformingPlanet Heroine · Astra / Blender` to the shared-world character picker
- makes the heroine the default shared-world avatar
- preserves Neptune Queen and Rapper as selectable characters
- allows the existing GAME-only approximate locomotion binding when the generated model has no usable native rig
- leaves Stripe, PayPal, subscriptions, prices, credit rates and customer balances unchanged.

Production run [36816617943](https://github.com/teslaeco/WORLDIFACT/actions/runs/36816617943), job `110222959900`, passed all release checks. It ran **615 tests: 615 passed, 0 failed**, typecheck/build/foundations/deployment dry-run, detailed-worker verification, payment no-charge readiness probes, Cloudflare deployment and public smoke. Cloudflare published version `052b2311-130a-428d-abf1-807a31b7361f` to https://worldifact.xodobrox.workers.dev.

## VERIFIED — exact production GLB readback

A separate no-cost post-deployment workflow [36816788673](https://github.com/teslaeco/WORLDIFACT/actions/runs/36816788673), job `110223489733`, fetched the public production route and required:

- HTTP success
- `Content-Type: model/gltf-binary`
- `X-WORLDIFACT-Avatar: TerraformingPlanet-Heroine-Astra`
- `X-WORLDIFACT-Source-Job: a8e67f26-7f72-4e90-a0b2-4f0f6ad0e781`
- valid GLB v2 header and exact embedded length
- payload larger than 10 MB.

Production returned exactly 15,281,768 bytes with SHA-256 `92d777562e0292f2175f2bf4c6580fb4df03614e38f738afec2efcd25ed3028a`, identical to the generated test GLB.

## PAYMENT / GENERATION SAFETY PRESERVED

PR #156 had already restored authenticated completed-cache accounting and the owner installed the Oracle helper successfully with `CACHE_ACCOUNTING_VERIFIED`, `max_provider_usd: 1.75`, `payment_settings_changed: false` and `WORLDIFACT_CACHE_FIX_INSTALLED`.

This heroine release does not revert the current payment plans and does not change the USD 1.75 Astra job cap.

## LIMITATIONS — do not overclaim

The model has not received a human visual-fidelity approval in this release. Structural success and production delivery do not prove that the face, hands, hair or outfit exactly match the supplied artwork.

FBX and separate PBR ZIP are not available for this character yet. GLB and BLEND are the verified outputs.

MAKE remains validation-required. No manufacturing approval, supplier acceptance or production-ready claim was created.

Release decision: **GO — the generated Astra heroine is live as the default TerraformingPlanet/WORLDIFACT shared-world GAME avatar. NO-GO for reference-perfect-likeness, FBX/PBR-complete or manufacturing-ready claims until separately verified.**


## VERIFIED — stuck Studio receipt recovery deployed (1 October 2026)

Owner evidence showed a selected Astra/Blender Studio job still displaying `Preparing your model…` after more than 92 minutes while recovery returned `This model belongs to a different account or has no account receipt.`

Root cause in the public client: that exact HTTP403 was treated as a transient polling failure. Polling eventually stopped, but the signed receipt remained selected as non-terminal, so the elapsed timer continued indefinitely and the generation UI stayed locked.

PR #164 merged as `f7c9eeb5f4add49dbb14eb2ad433dfd923eb3fab` after exact-head green checks. Production workflow [36904740422](https://github.com/teslaeco/WORLDIFACT/actions/runs/36904740422) completed successfully, including deploy and post-deploy detailed-route verification. Main CI [36904740551](https://github.com/teslaeco/WORLDIFACT/actions/runs/36904740551) also passed.

The repair:
- keeps HMAC receipts bound to the verified account UUID;
- never turns a receipt from another account into ownership;
- when the valid current-account receipt exists but its entitlement job row is missing, reads only the exact matching Oracle UUID;
- never starts another generation, reserves another job, debits points, grants credits or mutates Stripe/PayPal during recovery;
- returns `reconciliationRequired` instead of an endless elapsed timer;
- treats an Oracle 404 after the existing reconciliation window as terminal without financial mutation when no entitlement reservation exists;
- allows GET recovery of an already-succeeded exact Oracle artifact only when the current account still has an active subscription and no billing review;
- preserves the normal owned-job settlement/download path unchanged;
- contains a client compatibility path so the old exact ownership-403 enters same-job review instead of spinning indefinitely.

The Codex implementation contract is recorded in `docs/CODEX_TASK_STUCK_STUDIO_RECOVERY_20261001.md`.

No paid Astra generation was run for this repair. The specific owner's 92-minute receipt still requires one post-deploy browser recovery action to reveal whether its exact Oracle UUID succeeded, failed/cancelled, or is absent; do not claim that model itself recovered until that result is observed.
