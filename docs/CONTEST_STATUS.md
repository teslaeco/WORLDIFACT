# 15 October 2026 — ECOMECH V8 MAKE repair: TESTED, NOT PRINT APPROVED

[Draft PR #303](https://github.com/teslaeco/WORLDIFACT/pull/303) adds a source-bound offline MAKE preparation tool on a separate branch, without touching the V7 original GLB/textures or production. Actual V7 input SHA-256: `a9cf5b06e450577ef420a3c95b80017f401caf6c1674e10cc09e254be057dd48`. Its 86 connected fragments are converted into one closed, positive-volume solid copy with an added plinth. Local reopened STL has zero boundary edges, zero non-manifold edges, zero degenerate faces, consistent winding and dimensions 131.0761 × 55.3785 × 200.0000 mm. Real STL SHA-256: `e43e7d93156f879d4bced3a1baca3700c1ff7e537623477b15b94f56bfcdb17d`, 10,038,884 bytes, 200,776 faces. Eight local tests passed, including real STL/GLB reopening and mm/metre conversion.

The first [dedicated GitHub run #38725026445](https://github.com/teslaeco/WORLDIFACT/actions/runs/38725026445) independently reproduced the repair and passed all eight tests, but failed its render step because EGL/OSMesa libraries were absent. The corrected [full MAKE and actual-render workflow #38725425755](https://github.com/teslaeco/WORLDIFACT/actions/runs/38725425755) completed SUCCESS after installing Mesa/EGL/Xvfb on the ephemeral runner. No tests were disabled. Full repository CI after documentation changes must be observed separately.

**NO-GO for original-reference fidelity and manufacturing:** V8 repairs inherited V7 topology; it does NOT recover missing helmet/armor/hand/motor anatomy that was only represented in the source texture. The 200 mm resin profile is provisional. Two of 1,000 normal-ray chord samples remain below the 2 mm research target (minimum ~1.08 mm); this is not full wall-thickness validation. Self-intersection, slicer/support, selected resin, supplier engineering approval and a physical test print remain unverified. No order, premium release, merge, production change or paid AI call occurred. See `docs/ECOMECH_V8_MAKE_20261015.md` for measured evidence and limitations. GAME source and MAKE copy remain separate; STL does not contain color.

# 15 October 2026 — Single Chess menu and native unload protection: VERIFIED LIVE

## VERIFIED source and merge
- [Cube Chess PR #146](https://github.com/teslaeco/Cube-Chess-512-AI-Open-Source-3D-Chess-Engine-Autonomous-AI-Game-Developer/pull/146) merged as `3658ed1c5c1f83fe417f7a59218b8a439090cf0e`. Exact tested source `8f519bc37dd850dc886cbbaab02e0bcc0320f07e` passed the original game tests/build and [desktop+mobile browser menu/navigation matrix #38719645010](https://github.com/teslaeco/Cube-Chess-512-AI-Open-Source-3D-Chess-Engine-Autonomous-AI-Game-Developer/actions/runs/38719645010), both browser jobs SUCCESS. The tests confirmed exactly one in-game Exit control, a native beforeunload prompt during a real reload, cancel preserving the match, and no prompt after confirmed in-document exit. They also cover the existing game menu, About and premium HUD layout.
- [WORLDIFACT PR #301](https://github.com/teslaeco/WORLDIFACT/pull/301) merged as `d514699367675ad83e11d117688ae345567ab30d`, pinning the exact reviewed Chess source. [Verify WORLDIFACT #38719688102](https://github.com/teslaeco/WORLDIFACT/actions/runs/38719688102) and the four independent safety workflows all passed: full `npm run verify`, pinned Chess/Terra foundation assembly, Wrangler dry-run and read-only Studio inspection.

## User-requested behavior
- During a real Chess game the original small Menu control is hidden/disabled, so the top bar has only one visible **Exit to menu**. A literal escaped newline in the hide rule was diagnosed using failed [browser run #38718051008](https://github.com/teslaeco/Cube-Chess-512-AI-Open-Source-3D-Chess-Engine-Autonomous-AI-Game-Developer/actions/runs/38718051008), and fixed before the successful desktop/mobile rerun. The start/demo menu remains available.
- The existing Exit action still confirms loss of the current unfinished match without reloading. Saved games, profile, AI constraints, credits and 3D models are unchanged.
- Browsers receive a standards-based `beforeunload` request for a real active/paused/finished match when the user refreshes, enters another address or closes the tab. No warning is requested for the demo or after a deliberate in-app Exit. Browsers choose the wording and can skip prompts on some mobile app terminations; this is not automatic saving.
- No paid generation, backend modifications, subscription, billing, secret synchronization or Oracle restart occurred.

## VERIFIED LIVE — Cloudflare publication

The owner-authorized source release [#38720659648](https://github.com/teslaeco/WORLDIFACT/actions/runs/38720659648), job `116374114016`, completed **SUCCESS** on release commit `50825a0632979e6e14bd74ff1ba0204eb977226b`. Cloudflare version `bd085cf6-ff55-4321-a511-87c57a4d2908`, public origin https://worldifact.xodobrox.workers.dev; game https://worldifact.xodobrox.workers.dev/chess.

Release gate PASS: 2314/2314 unchanged WORLDIFACT tests, green lint/typecheck/build, exact Chess/Terra foundation assembly, Wrangler dry-run, and `wrangler deploy --keep-vars` with potentially sensitive CLI output suppressed. The `PUBLIC_RELEASE_VERIFIED` receipt confirmed **12 HTML routes and 437 static assets** matching built bytes/MIME, `GET /account/worlds` 200, expected six-portal/partner resource markers, actual compiled Chess `beforeunload`+legacy `returnValue` and CSS `open-menu[hidden]` markers, and Studio READY with Astra/Sol/Luna. The independent Cube Chess [desktop/mobile Chromium browser test #38719645010](https://github.com/teslaeco/Cube-Chess-512-AI-Open-Source-3D-Chess-Engine-Autonomous-AI-Game-Developer/actions/runs/38719645010) passed both jobs before merging the exact Chess source.

No paid generation, payment change, secret synchronization or Oracle restart was performed. The previous Cloudflare version `dbd875c7-26d5-42c5-b6d9-bbe3f48708e8` is superseded. Physical Android visual QA, iOS and actual signed-in session testing remain UNKNOWN. Browser-native warnings have browser-specific wording and mobile limitations; automatic saving is not claimed.

## Release method and preserving protections
**COMPLETED (see verified LIVE receipt above):** One-use `.github/workflows/single-chess-exit-release-once.yml` is armed by `ops/SINGLE_CHESS_EXIT_RELEASE_20261015.json`. Its strict parent and exact-four-file allowlist restrict the published change to this already merged, reviewed release. It reruns the original full verify/foundations and Wrangler dry-run, deploys the existing reviewed preserving config with `--keep-vars`, and requires an actual Cloudflare receipt, matching 12 HTML routes and all public asset bytes/MIME, Chess unload/single-menu JS+CSS markers and a read-only Studio READY check before declaring LIVE.

Prior Cloudflare version `dbd875c7-26d5-42c5-b6d9-bbe3f48708e8` is superseded by the LIVE version above. Physical Android and signed-in account testing remain UNKNOWN.

## Preserved previous status
Prior status is stored byte-for-byte in [CONTEST_STATUS.before-single-chess-exit-20261015.md](CONTEST_STATUS.before-single-chess-exit-20261015.md), original blob `ab5f26d4c64863ec3b68296cbcc139070d14f11f`. Earlier published status claims are historical and not proof that this specific bug fix is already live.
